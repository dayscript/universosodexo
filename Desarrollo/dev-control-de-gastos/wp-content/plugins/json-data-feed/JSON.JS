Why? The answer lies in advertisements.","content":"Google has started providing <a title=\"Google Fiber\" href=\"https:\/\/fiber.google.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\">free internet access<\/a> to a select few cities with plans for more. So I ask this question: <strong>When everyone else is charging, why would Google provide the service for free?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOkay, it's not completely free. Google Fiber requires an initial $300 construction fee to set your house up and for the necessary network box. You also have the option to upgrade to a Gigabit connection for $70 a month, which offers a 1024 Mbps line, compared to the normal 20-75 Mbps that most providers offer at around the same cost. You can even add cable TV for an additional $50.\r\n\r\nSo what's Google's motivation for doing this? Simple: <strong>advertising<\/strong>. In 2011, <a href=\"http:\/\/investor.google.com\/financial\/tables.html\" target=\"_blank\">Google's revenue<\/a> was $37.9 billion, with 96% of that stemming from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/01\/23\/google-revenues\" target=\"_blank\">advertising<\/a>. In 2012, that revenue jumped to $50.1 billion with 91% coming from advertising.\r\n\r\nWith such a huge portion of its revenue coming from ads, it makes sense that Google would want to get as many people as possible online in order to serve them targeted ads. To that end, in January 2012, Google rolled out <a href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2013\/01\/08\/google-nyc-wifi\/\" target=\"_blank\">the biggest free Wi-Fi network<\/a> in New York City.\r\n\r\nThis ideology of Google trying to get its system into as many people's homes as possible also matches the plan for its <a title=\"Google Nexus\" href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/nexus\/\" target=\"_blank\">Nexus<\/a> phone and tablet. Google's Nexus line matches Apple's lineup of phones and tablets in specs, but Google's are generally <a href=\"http:\/\/news.cnet.com\/8301-1035_3-57466486-94\/nexus-7-leaves-google-with-razor-thin-profit-margin\/\" target=\"_blank\">cheaper<\/a>","meta":{"dsq_thread_id":"dsq_thread_id"},"featured_image":"3984"},{"title":"Fishing for Fans and Followers, Pt. 8: Connect ASAP","permalink":"http:\/\/xiik.com\/responsive\/index.php\/fishing-for-fans-and-followers-pt-8-connect-asap\/","publishDate":"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 10:56:59 +0000","author":"Tristan Schmid","category":"\t\t<category><![CDATA[Advice]]><\/category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Digital Marketing]]><\/category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[best practices]]><\/category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[content marketing]]><\/category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Fishing for Fans and Followers]]><\/category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[LinkedIn]]><\/category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[presentations]]><\/category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Revenue North]]><\/category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[small business]]><\/category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[social media marketing]]><\/category>\n","guid":"http:\/\/xiik.com\/responsive\/?p=4014","excerpt":"Social media is about as top-of-mind as you can get in marketing; don","content":"<em><em>This post is the last in","meta":{"dsq_thread_id":"dsq_thread_id"},"featured_image":"4124"},{"title":"5 Reasons You Should Hire A Full Service Agency","permalink":"http:\/\/xiik.com\/responsive\/index.php\/5-reasons-you-should-hire-a-full-service-agency\/","publishDate":"Wed, 01 May 2013 10:23:29 +0000","author":"Bryan Engh","category":"\t\t<category><![CDATA[Advice]]><\/category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Digital Marketing]]><\/category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[full-service marketing]]><\/category>\n","guid":"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/?p=3942","excerpt":"Though specialty marketing companies have their place, the insights and flexibility of full service agencies cannot be matched. Here's why.","content":"It used to be commonplace for companies to trust one advertising agency with all their marketing, branding and strategy development. However, as the interactive marketing space grew in\u00a0the late '90s, <a title=\"Central Indiana Marketing Agencies and Technology Companies\" href=\"http:\/\/www.marketingtechblog.com\/central-indiana-marketing-companies\/\" target=\"_blank\">specialty agencies<\/a> began popping up all over the place. These boutique agencies focused all their skills in one specific area, became experts in it and worked almost exclusively on specialty projects. Today, you can easily find an agency that focuses solely on any of the services, channels, platforms, or media that are used to market your business today.\n\nOver the past five years or so, though, interactive knowledge has evolved and expanded significantly, and full service agencies are becoming a popular choice again. Instead of investing in only one specialty, full service agencies (like <a title=\"Services\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/services\/\">xiik<\/a>)\u00a0develop departments of people who are experts in different areas within one company.\n\nWhile both types of agencies offer many strengths, it's more efficient to engage a full service agency as your marketing partner. <strong>Here are five\u00a0reasons to let one agency\u00a0get behind the wheel of all your marketing efforts:<\/strong>\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Smooth and Responsive Communication\n<\/strong>One point of contact. One relationship to manage. With one agency by your side, you don't have to juggle different communication lines within each marketing campaign. No more frustration from trying to discern the overall direction of your marketing efforts based on advice from different companies. At a full service agency, you'll have\u00a0a talented <a title=\"Our Team\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/team\/\">account manager<\/a> walking with you at every stage: from kickoff, through each department and all the way through deployment and analysis. Less time managing communications means more time focusing on how well your brand is performing.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Brand Consistency\n<\/strong>A full service agency typically works on a much deeper level with each client. They gain more insights into your business and the industry as a whole, making it easier to discover the most powerful ways to reach your audience through the best channels. Whether <a title=\"Digital Marketing Services\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/services\/digital\">developing a new website<\/a>,\u00a0<a title=\"Design services\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/services\/design\">designing<\/a> an entire identity system,\u00a0planning <a title=\"Social media marketing tips: Fishing for Fans and Followers\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/blog\/?tag=fishing-for-fans-and-followers\">social media efforts<\/a>, constructing <a title=\"Creating Prairie Godmothers packaging\" href=\"http:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/RdJvqtHjU7\/\" target=\"_blank\">product packaging<\/a>, or creatively directing a video production,<em>\u00a0<\/em><em><a title=\"The Brand Gap: How to bridge the distance between business strategy and design\" href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/coolstuff\/the-brand-gap\" target=\"_blank\">everything you do must be real and true to your brand<\/a><\/em><strong>.<\/strong> Full service agencies have the insights and the skills to bring everything together to serve your brand's purpose and make sure the market perceives you the right way.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>A Wealth of Services<\/strong>\nBrands need to be seen in multiple places, <a title=\"Mobile Madness: Capturing Users Across Mobile Devices\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/mobile-madness-capturing-users-across-mobile-devices\/\">on multiple screens<\/a>\u00a0and by <a title=\"xiik blog posts about target audiences\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/blog\/?tag=target-audiences\">multiple audiences<\/a>. It can be extremely time consuming to employ a different agency for each part of your overarching strategy. The full service agency can handle everything for you in one place. Whether you need a\u00a0<a title=\"xiik Branding services\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/services\/branding\">brand discovery exercise<\/a>, <a title=\"xiik Strategy services\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/services\/strategy\">overall strategy consultation<\/a>, <a title=\"Digital services\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/services\/digital\">app development<\/a>, or copywriting, your agency can execute all these projects while keeping the consistency of your brand intact.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Ease of Future Projects<\/strong>\nAny good agency needs a little time to learn about your business and how you fit in your market. After engaging with a full service agency, future projects will be more easily launched from the insights already developed about your brand.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Integration Over Specialization\n<\/strong>Smaller specialty agencies often lack the skills to execute projects in channels outside of their area of expertise, whereas full service agencies have all the right skills to help you branch out into anything fitting within the true identity of your brand. Full service agencies are also able to measure and analyze everything you do on any platform to provide the most accurate picture of your performance and position in the market.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2012\/08\/23\/boutique-traditional-media-agency\/\" target=\"_blank\">Every agency brings value to the table<\/a> in some way or another.

The restaurant's team, who quickly garnered the honor of being a\u00a0<a title=\"James Beard Foundation Awards 2013 nominees\" href=\"http:\/\/www.jamesbeard.org\/sites\/default\/files\/static\/additional\/2013-jbf-nominees.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">James Beard Foundation Award<\/a> <a title=\"James Beard Award Foundation Semifinalist for Best New Restaurant: Bluebeard\" href=\"http:\/\/www.jamesbeard.org\/awards\/search\/bluebeard?f[0]=sm_field_award_status%3A3\" target=\"_blank\">semi-finalist<\/a>, wanted\u00a0to better share its philosophy of culinary exploration and focus on daily menus inspired by local harvests from around Indianapolis.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/xiik.com\/responsive\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/bluebeard-restaurant-menus.gif\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4145\" alt=\"Bluebeard Restaurant menu designs\" src=\"http:\/\/xiik.com\/responsive\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/bluebeard-restaurant-menus.gif\" width=\"667\" height=\"501\" \/><\/a>\n\n<a title=\"Our Team\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/our-team\/\">The xiik team<\/a> spent many enjoyable hours in the restaurant, observing diners and the Bluebeard crew while savoring creations made with the finest, freshest ingredients.\n\nWe developed Bluebeard's menu family based on these <strong>key considerations for restaurant menu design:<\/strong>\n\n<img class=\"alignnone\" alt=\"Bluebeard restaurant typewriter and dinner menu\" src=\"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/06_Bluebeard_Images-883x663.gif\" width=\"667\" \/>\n<h2>The Diners.<\/h2>\nMenus are one of the first and most important items a\u00a0guest encounters during the dining experience, so they need to present the brand and concept of the restaurant quickly and effectively.\n\nBluebeard's menus make subtle nods to the restaurant's namesake -\u00a0<a title=\"Bluebeard on Wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bluebeard_(Vonnegut_novel)\" target=\"_blank\">a novel<\/a>\u00a0by Indy native <a title=\"Kurt Vonnegut\" href=\"http:\/\/www.vonnegut.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Kurt Vonnegut<\/a>\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0and guide the diner through the selection process with a flow sensibly arranged by courses.\n\nAnd because menus are one of the first tactile sensations of the restaurant dining experience, the selection of papers and materials is just as important as the typography and layout. Papers were hand-selected by the Bluebeard team, and drink menus are affixed to a wooden board that distinctively sets it apart from the food menu.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone\" alt=\"Bluebeard drink menus and restaurant place settings\" src=\"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/08_Bluebeard_Images-883x663.gif\" width=\"667\" \/>\n<h2>The Environment.<\/h2>\n<a title=\"xiik blog posts about usability\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/blog\/?tag=usability\">Usability<\/a> in marketing <a title=\"Why Parking Meters Suck But Vacuums Don\u2019t: The Importance of Usability Testing\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/why-parking-meters-suck-but-vacuums-dont-the-importance-of-usability-testing\/\">isn't just a digital consideration<\/a>, as Bluebeard's menus prove; the setting in which printed marketing pieces will be used affects their effectiveness.\n\nAt Bluebeard's building, a factory warehouse built in 1924, bright sunlight can stream into the restaurant on winter days, and outdoor dining is considerably dimmer on late summer nights. Bluebeard's menus are\u00a0legible regardless.\n\nThe menus are also sized to fit the tables. Bluebeard's warm space is intimate, so snack, drink, and dessert menus are smaller, while main-course menus are larger without being bulky.\n\nMenu usability extends to the restaurant staff, who\u00a0can\u00a0easily replace old\u00a0drink menus with new, thanks to simple thumbscrews on the wooden boards.\n\nEditable digital files also make it easy for the team to change the menu daily to reflect the kitchen's freshest creations.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone\" alt=\"Bluebeard menu design\" src=\"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/09_Bluebeard_Images-883x663.gif\" width=\"667\" \/>\n<h2>The Food.<\/h2>\nAs important as atmosphere and service are, what matters most in a fine dining experience is the food; well-designed menus represent their restaurant's cuisine appropriately and set the tone for what the diner is about to enjoy.\n\nThough <a title=\"Chow.com: All That Menu Psychology Stuff Is Bull\" href=\"http:\/\/www.chow.com\/food-news\/105108\/all-that-menu-psychology-stuff-is-bull\/\" target=\"_blank\">some advocate for<\/a> the inclusion of photos of the meals on menus, we chose not to for a variety of reasons, not the least of which are space and the difficulty of obtaining quality photos every day.\n\nWe also carefully considered how each item would be read by the diner, choosing to let the the titles, ingredients and descriptions - rather than prices - guide decisions.\n\nAs <a title=\"About Bluebeard\" href=\"http:\/\/bluebeardindy.com\/about-us\/\" target=\"_blank\">John Adams<\/a>, Bluebeard Co-Chef, said, xiik put as much attention into the designs' detail as his team puts into the ingredients of their cuisine.\n<h2><strong><a title=\"Bluebeard menu designs\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xiik.com\/portfolio\/bluebeard-2\/\">See more of the menus<\/a>\u00a0in our portfolio, and for a closer look, <a title=\"Bluebeard Restaurant in Indianapolis\" href=\"http:\/\/bluebeardindy.com\" target=\"_blank\">dine at Bluebeard<\/a>.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h2><\/h2>","meta":{"dsq_needs_sync":"dsq_needs_sync","dsq_thread_id":"dsq_thread_id"},"featured_image":"4189"}]}
